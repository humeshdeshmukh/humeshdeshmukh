## Step 3: Set Up the Snake Animation

1. In your `humeshdeshmukh` repository, create the folder structure:

   └── workflows/
       └── snake.yml
   ```

2. Copy the content from `.github/workflows/snake.yml` in this folder

   - Click **"Actions"** tab
   - Click **"Generate Snake Animation"** workflow
   - Click **"Run workflow"** → **"Run workflow"** (green button)
   - Wait for it to complete (about 1-2 minutes)
